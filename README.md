# configurable-traffic-simulater

configurable-traffic-simulater is a courswork project. The task is to implement a configurable traffic light simulator using FeatureHouse adn JAVA. The program will simulate an
intersection that is managed by traffic lights. The variants of the simulation differ in the number of roads that merge
at the intersection, whether there are pedestrian crossings present, and how the traffic lights behave. The program will generate variants depending on the
set of features selected by the user.
